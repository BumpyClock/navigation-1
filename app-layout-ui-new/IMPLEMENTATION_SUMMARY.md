# Implementation Summary

## Architecture Overview

This package provides a comprehensive, customizable application layout component with:

- Responsive sidebar navigation
- Team switcher
- Settings panel
- User dropdown menu
- Dark/light mode support
- Customizable theming
- Accessibility features
- Fully responsive design with different behavior at mobile and desktop breakpoints

## Key Components

### AppLayout

The main layout component that orchestrates all UI elements. It serves as the primary entry point for the library.

```tsx
<AppLayout
  siteInfo={siteInfo}
  sidebarNavItems={sidebarNavItems}
  showSettingsPanel={true}
>
  <YourAppContent />
</AppLayout>
```

### AppSidebar

Provides navigation through a collapsible sidebar with primary and secondary navigation groups.

### MainContent

A flexible content container component that:
- Renders the main application content
- Supports an optional header area (either a string title or custom React component)
- Includes an optional settings panel trigger
- Adapts to different viewport sizes

```tsx
// Using a string title
<AppLayout contentHeader="Dashboard" showSettingsPanelTrigger={true}>
  <YourAppContent />
</AppLayout>

// Using a custom component header
<AppLayout 
  contentHeader={
    <div className="flex justify-between">
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      <Button>New Item</Button>
    </div>
  }
>
  <YourAppContent />
</AppLayout>

// No header
<AppLayout>
  <YourAppContent />
</AppLayout>
```

### SettingsPanel

A configurable panel for application settings that can be toggled with keyboard shortcuts or UI controls.

### TeamSwitcher

Allows users to switch between different teams or workspaces.

### UserDropdown

Provides user account functionality and actions.

## State Management

The package implements a lightweight state management system using React context:

- `SidebarProvider` - Manages sidebar state (expanded/collapsed)
- `SettingsPanelProvider` - Controls settings panel visibility
- `AppLayoutStateProvider` - Coordinates global layout state

## Theming

Theming is implemented through:
- CSS variables for color customization
- Dark/light mode support
- Theme validation to ensure accessibility

## Performance Optimizations

- Component memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Error boundaries for graceful failure handling
- Lazy loading for improved initial load performance

## Accessibility

- Proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management

## Responsive Behavior

The layout adapts to different screen sizes with different interaction patterns:

### Desktop (â‰¥ 1024px by default)
- Sidebar appears inline on the left, pushing content to the right
- Settings panel appears inline on the right, pushing content to the left
- Content area automatically adjusts its width based on sidebar and settings panel state
- Collapsible sidebar and settings panel expand/collapse in place

### Mobile (< 1024px by default)
- Sidebar appears as a slide-out Sheet from the left edge
- Settings panel appears as a slide-out Sheet from the right edge
- Content takes full width of the viewport
- Overlay mode for sidebar and settings panel to preserve content space

The mobile breakpoint (1024px) can be customized through the `mobileBreakpoint` prop.
