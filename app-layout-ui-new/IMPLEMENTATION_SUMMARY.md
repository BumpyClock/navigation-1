   - Keyboard navigation
   - Proper focus management

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests using Jest/React Testing Library
   - Add visual regression tests
   - Implement browser compatibility testing

2. **Documentation**:
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Add more detailed usage examples
   - Document theme customization options

3. **Build & Publishing**:
   - Set up tsup for proper ESM/CJS builds
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Publish to npm

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Add animation settings
   - Implement more extensive theming options
   - Support additional navigation patterns

5. **Integration**:
   - Create more framework-specific examples (CRA, Svelte, Vue)
   - Add integration guides for popular frameworks

## Usage Instructions

```tsx
import { AppLayout } from 'app-layout-ui';

function MyApp() {
  // Define custom navigation items
  const sidebarNavItems = {
    main: {
      title: "Navigation",
      url: "#",
      items: [
        {
          title: "Dashboard",
          url: "/dashboard",
          icon: "dashboard",
          isActive: true,
        },
        {
          title: "Projects",
          url: "/projects",
          icon: "computer",
        },
      ]
    }
  };

  return (
    <AppLayout
      sidebarNavItems={sidebarNavItems}
      showSettingsPanel={true}
    >
      <div className="p-6">
        <h1>My Application Content</h1>
        {/* Your app content here */}
      </div>
    </AppLayout>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

The implemented AppLayout component package provides a robust, customizable, and accessible solution for application layouts. The component structure follows best practices for React component libraries, with clear separation of concerns, appropriate TypeScript typing, and extensive customization options.

The package is now ready for basic usage and can be further enhanced with the next steps outlined above before full production release.
